# Description
Create a simple to-do list application that allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The application should have a clean and intuitive user interface, with features such as:

1. Add new tasks with a title and optional description.
2. Edit existing tasks to update their title, description, or completion status.
3. Delete tasks that are no longer needed.
4. Mark tasks as completed or incomplete.
5. Filter tasks based on their completion status (e.g., show all tasks, show only completed tasks, show only incomplete tasks).
6. Persist tasks locally or in a database to ensure data is saved between sessions.
7. Implement basic authentication to allow users to log in and access their own to-do lists.
